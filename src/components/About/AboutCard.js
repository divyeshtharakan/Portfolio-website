            Hey folks, I am <span className="purple">Divyesh Tharakan </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Pune,India.</span>
            <br />
            I have previously worked as a Software Engineer at Persistent Systems, Pune where I contributed to the development of configurations of a few AWS services and closely monitored the logs at the production level. Also assisted the senior team in automating day-to-day tasks in Python.
            Also interned with them where I gained knowlegable insights about SIEM, OWASP and other security tools.
            <br />
            I am currently pursuing my Masters in Information Security (MTech) from VIT, Vellore, where I am learning about cybersecurity, including various tools and techniques used in the field, and also in courses such as Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessment to enhance my security analysis skills.
            <br />
            <br />
            Beyond my professional work, I enjoy engaging in various activities that bring me joy and fulfillment:
